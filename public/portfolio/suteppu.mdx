Suteppu is a Visual Studio Code Extension that can be use to step by step copy paste code-- presenting like what Fireship did in his video. I made this extension as a fun project and was intended to use it as a way to teach without ever having to type any code... and yea I know, I know... you can do all of this by just removing and stepping back using the built-in undo system from VSCode. But with this extension, you can save your steps into a file for use later on in the future.

Welp... it's still kinda a useless extension tbh.
