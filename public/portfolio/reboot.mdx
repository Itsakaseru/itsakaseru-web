Project Reboot is my ongoing full-stack personal project that rework the original onKeys game entirely from the ground up. This rework goes far beyond just the gameâ€”it includes the development of a fully integrated system featuring a website, backend API, and database, all will be hosted across multiple cloud servers.

The project is still a **work in progress**, most of its details remain confidential at this stage. As development progresses, some information will be made publicly available. For those interested in staying updated, you're welcome to join the project's [Discord community server.](https://reboot.skyencripttion.com/discord)
