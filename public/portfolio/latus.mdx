Latus is a very simple social media website built for our Web Programming mid-term project using HTML, CSS and pure PHP. Upon login you can discover "friends" that you can visit and comment on their own posts, it's kinda like Twitter but more open to the public. You can change your profile picture, change your profile theme, add a background image to your profile, make a post either with text and or a picture added in.

In this project, I work mainly on the design for the website. I'm also doing the backend for the website with the rest of the team.
