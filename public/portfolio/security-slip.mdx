Security SLip or we like to call it SSL lol, is a simulation game where your job is to make sure all the people who come in, come ou- I mean umm... They have proper entry cards. We got inspired by the game Paper Please, we thought since it's a 2D game why not make it 3D with a little bit more twist?
This game was built for our Game Design and Development 2 final project. With the limited time given, there are still many game components that are still not yet implemented.

In this project, I work mainly on the design of the game (UI, UX) with my friend. I'm also doing the backend for the game with the rest of the team.
