# About Me
Hi you can called me Lemuel, Lemi or Sakii.

I’m just another human being living on earth. A human who have always been fascinated by technology whether it software or hardware. I’m myself is a programmer, currently working on a big project making my own game. I own two YouTube channels, [SkyEncripttion](https://youtube.com/SkyEncripttion): ~~a gaming channel~~, and [Itsakaseru](https://youtube.com/Itsakaseru): unknown.

Other than technologies, I like all things about dreaming. I got interested since I was a kid in how and why dream itself is possible. As well as the story of the dreams that I went through throughout my life. I always wonder how dream are construct and why it sometimes, have unique things happening inside it. In the future I would like to share my experiences within the dream itself.

With that said, I’m also want to try writing my own novel, the idea of the story itself is inspired from all the dreams that I’ve experienced. Sadly, I don’t have enough confidence to write it currently, maybe in the future I’ll try it regardless.

If you want contact me, you can do it through my email [contact@itsakaseru.me](mailto:contact@itsakaseru.me)
(Though I don't know why you would want to contact me to be completely honest xD)
