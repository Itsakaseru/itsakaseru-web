MateMatirun is a math learning based rhythm game, where you do the rhythm while doing some math questions at the same time until the end of the song. It was built for our Game Design and Development 1 final project. We combined our team ideas into one, and the result is spectacular! at least it's what we think.

In this project, I work mainly on the design of the game (UI, UX). I'm also doing the backend for the game with the rest of the team.
