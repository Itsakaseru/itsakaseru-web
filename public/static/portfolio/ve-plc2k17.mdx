This project is the result of one of my job being a documenter for my yearly high school event. I was tasked to make a video kinda like an ad for it, or maybe a trailer I guess? frankly, I don't really know how to describe it. With the same attitude as when I was making my lyrics video. I'm doing this to practice my video editing skills.

I'm only mainly doing the editing works, all the video assets were made by another or previous documenter and given to me. The deadline was really tight on this one, They said it can be extended, but given the date of the event, I felt bad if the video was posted late. It was a fun event in my opinion, but unfortunately, I was sicked after it lol xD. This was the result.
