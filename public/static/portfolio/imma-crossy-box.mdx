Imma Crossy Box is a simulation game where you are a box that only had one goal. Deliver itself into someoneâ€™s house. We got inspired by the game crossy road on mobile. From that, we want to make it more challenging and by making the main player a box and controlling it with multiple inputs, we think we reached our goal. This game was built for our Computer Graphics and Animation final project.

In this project, I work mainly on the design of the game (UI, UX). I'm also doing the backend for the game with the rest of the team.
