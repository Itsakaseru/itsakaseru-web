This project was made for optional assignments in my multimedia concept courses. The assignment is to make a lyrics video from any songs that I want. I'm not really good at making motion graphics back then, I can only do simple animations in after effects. But, I decided to make this. I'm making this to practice my skills in making motion graphics using after effects.

Back then, I was really stocked with the result. Even though it lacks some things that might need to be added like smooth animation, better colour palette, etc...
