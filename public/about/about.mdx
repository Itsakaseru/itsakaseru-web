# About Me
Hi, you can call me Lemuel, Lemi or Sakii.

I’m just another human being living on earth. A human who has always been fascinated by technology, whether it is software or hardware. I’m myself is a programmer, currently working on a big project making my own game. I own two YouTube channels, [SkyEncripttion](https://youtube.com/SkyEncripttion): ~~a gaming channel~~, and [Itsakaseru](https://youtube.com/Itsakaseru): unknown.

Other than technologies, I like all things about dreaming. I got interested since I was a kid in how and why the dream itself is possible. As well as the story of the dreams that I went through throughout my life. I always wonder how a dream is constructed and why it sometimes, has unique things happening inside it. In the future I would like to share my experiences within the dream itself.

With that said, I also wanted to try writing my own novel; the idea of the story itself is inspired from all the dreams that I’ve experienced. Sadly, I don’t have enough confidence to write it currently, maybe in the future I’ll try it regardless.

If you want to contact me, you can do it through my email [contact@itsakaseru.me](mailto:contact@itsakaseru.me)
(Though I don't know why you would want to contact me to be completely honest xD)
