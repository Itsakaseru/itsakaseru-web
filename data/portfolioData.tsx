I\'m doing this to practice my video editing skills.\n\nI\'m only mainly doing the editing works, all the video assets were made by another or previous documenter and given to me. The deadline was really tight on this one, They said it can be extended, but given the date of the event, I felt bad if the video was posted late. It was a fun event in my opinion, but unfortunately, I was sicked after it lol xD. This was the result.",
